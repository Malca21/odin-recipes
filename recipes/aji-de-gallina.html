    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ají de Gallina is a popular Peruvian stew, known for its creamy, savory, 
        and slightly spicy flavor. It features shredded chicken (traditionally 
        hen, but often replaced with chicken) in a rich sauce made with aji 
        amarillo (yellow chili pepper), milk, bread, nuts (usually walnuts or 
        pecans), and Parmesan cheese. The dish is typically served with boiled 
        potatoes, white rice, and sometimes a boiled egg and olives.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 loaf white bread, crusts removed and cubed</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup walnut pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons aji amarillo chile paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>4 hard-cooked eggs, sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup kalamata olives, pitted and quartered</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts, onion, carrot, and 2 cloves garlic in a 
            large saucepan, pour in 2 quarts of water and slowly bring to 
            a simmer over medium-high heat. Skim off the foam which forms 
            on top, then cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until 
            the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate 
            and allow to cool. Strain the resulting chicken stock, discarding 
            the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pour evaporated milk and 1/2 cup chicken stock into the bowl of a
             blender. Add bread cubes and puree until smooth. Add Parmesan 
             cheese and walnuts; puree until smooth. Shred the cooled chicken 
             and discard the bones.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 
            minced garlic and minced onion; cook until the onion has softened 
            and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in shredded chicken 
            and aji amarillo until heated through. Pour in bread puree and cook 
            until hot, stirring frequently. Add more chicken stock if needed to 
            keep from getting too thick. Season with turmeric and simmer for 5 
            minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve garnished with hard-cooked egg slices and sprinkled with 
            kalamata olives.</li>
    </ol>
